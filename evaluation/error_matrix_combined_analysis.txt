========================================
OVERALL ERROR RATES
========================================

1. Linear Regression:  53.43% error rate

========================================
KEY FINDINGS
========================================

CENTER POSITION (C) WEAKNESS:
All models struggle significantly when the center position is occupied.
The center appears in 9 of the top 10 highest error combinations for each model.

Linear Regression - Center Error Rate:
  - TM + C: 58.9%
  - C + MR: 58.1%
  - ML + C: 56.9%
  - TR + C: 56.0%
  - TL + C: 55.8%

Q-Learning - Center Error Rate:
  - ML + C: 62.2%
  - TM + C: 61.8%
  - TL + C: 60.7%
  - C + BR: 59.9%
  - C + C: 59.8%

Naive Bayes - Center Error Rate:
  - Generally high errors (72-79%) across all position pairs
  - Doesn't learn positional strategy effectively

========================================
CORNER STRATEGY ANALYSIS
========================================

Bottom Right (BR) Corner:
- Naive Bayes struggles most: ML+BR (79.6%), BL+BR (78.4%), TR+BR (77.5%)
- Linear Regression: 52-55% error (moderate confusion)
- Q-Learning: 51-55% error (moderate confusion)

Middle Left (ML) Position:
- Naive Bayes: ML+BR (79.6%), ML+BM (79.1%), TR+ML (78.6%)
- Q-Learning: ML+C (62.2%) - highest error combination
- Linear Regression: ML+C (56.9%), ML+MR (55.5%)

========================================
MODEL COMPARISON
========================================

LINEAR REGRESSION (Best Overall):
- Lowest error rate: 53.43%
- Most problematic: Center interactions (55-59% error)
- Best performance: Corner positions alone (~50-51% error)
- Learned weak spatial patterns but better than alternatives

Q-LEARNING (Second Best):
- Error rate: 54.08% (slightly worse than Linear Regression)
- Severe center blindness: 57-62% error when center involved
- Good corner recognition: 49-54% error
- Optimized for gameplay, not static classification

NAIVE BAYES (Worst):
- Highest error rate: 76.32%
- Failed to learn positional strategy
- Consistently high errors (72-80%) across all positions
- Binary prediction bias (rarely predicts draws)

========================================
POSITION-PAIR ERROR HEAT MAP SUMMARY
========================================

Lowest Error Positions (Best Predictions):
- TR + BL: 48.9% (Q-Learning) - Best single combination
- TL + BL: 50.8% (Linear Regression)
- TR + ML: 49.9% (Linear Regression)

Highest Error Positions (Most Confusion):
- ML + BR: 79.6% (Naive Bayes) - Worst combination
- ML + BM: 79.1% (Naive Bayes)
- ML + C: 62.2% (Q-Learning)

========================================
STRATEGIC INSIGHTS
========================================

1. CENTER DOMINANCE PROBLEM:
   All models fail to properly evaluate center position importance.
   In Tic-Tac-Toe strategy, center is crucial, but models show 
   55-62% error rates when center is involved.

2. CORNER STRATEGY RECOGNITION:
   Linear Regression and Q-Learning show moderate corner understanding
   (~50-53% error), but this is still barely better than random (50%).

3. NAIVE BAYES FAILURE:
   76% error rate indicates Naive Bayes assumption of feature 
   independence is invalid for Tic-Tac-Toe, where position 
   interactions are critical.

4. MODEL SUITABILITY:
   - Static Classification: Linear Regression performs best
   - Gameplay (sequential): Q-Learning excels (despite high error here)
   - Avoid: Naive Bayes for any Tic-Tac-Toe task

========================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================

1. FEATURE ENGINEERING:
   Add explicit features for:
   - Center occupancy state
   - Corner pair formations (TL+BR, TR+BL)
   - Line completion potential (rows, columns, diagonals)

2. MODEL ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Linear Regression: Add polynomial features for position interactions
   - Q-Learning: Separate evaluation for static vs sequential decisions
   - Naive Bayes: Consider Bayesian Networks to model dependencies

3. TRAINING IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Increase center position weight in loss function
   - Augment dataset with strategic position importance labels
   - Use domain knowledge to guide feature importance

4. EVALUATION CONTEXT:
   - Use Q-Learning for actual gameplay (where it excels)
   - Use Linear Regression for outcome prediction
   - Consider ensemble methods combining model strengths

========================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
========================================

Error Matrix Calculation:
- Only counts position pairs where both positions are occupied
- Error = (predicted_label != actual_label)
- Minimum 10 samples required for "Top 10" ranking reliability

Position Labels:
  TL = Top Left       TM = Top Middle      TR = Top Right
  ML = Middle Left    C = Center           MR = Middle Right
  BL = Bottom Left    BM = Bottom Middle   BR = Bottom Right

Dataset Format:
- Character format: x (player), o (opponent), b (blank)
- Labels: win (+1), draw (0), lose (-1)
- Non-terminal positions only (game still in progress)

========================================
CONCLUSION
========================================

The 9x9 error matrix reveals that all models struggle with:
1. Center position evaluation (55-62% error)
2. Position interaction understanding (low variance across pairs)
3. Strategic pattern recognition (near-random performance)

Linear Regression achieves the lowest error rate (53.43%) but still
performs only marginally better than random guessing (50%). This 
indicates fundamental limitations in the models' ability to learn
Tic-Tac-Toe spatial strategy from static board positions alone.

The high center-related error rates across all models suggest that
position importance is not being captured by current feature 
representations. Future work should focus on explicit strategic 
feature engineering rather than relying on models to discover 
these patterns from raw position data.
